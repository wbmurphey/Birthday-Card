# Birthday-Card
A birthday card app made for a dear friend who was moving out of the country at the time. I created this app with help from a developer friend of mine who helped me package the app with py2app, and helped explain some basic principles of creating an app. In this repository are the two python files that I wrote for the app (Main.py and list_of_things.py) and a screenshot of the UI I designed for the birthday card (Birthday_Card_Screenshot.jpg).

A user can click the buttons on the left to display either a bithday message, a randomly ordered list of the things my friend and I did together in 2020, a single random entry from the list, or to clear the text area.
